.SYNOPSIS
	Name: Secure-WindowsServices.ps1
	Description: The purpose of this script is to secure any Windows services with insecure permissions and unquoted paths.

.NOTES
	Author:                                 Ben Hooper (https://mythofechelon.co.uk/ / https://github.com/mythofechelon/Secure-WindowsServices/releases/latest)
	Tested on:                              Windows 10 v21H1 64-bit
	Version:                                1.15
	Changes in v1.15 (2022/08/29 14:48):    Added proper handling of services where the arguments contain ".exe". This scenario revealed a greedy regex which caused the remainder of the script to operate on the image path / entire command line string, rather than just the path to executable, resulting in (1) failed / errored permission remediations and/or (2) incorrect / invalid quotation mark wrapping. Reported at https://github.com/astrixsystems/Secure-WindowsServices/issues/2
	Changes in v1.14 (2021/10/17 14:21):    Added parameter "ReportOnly" and tweaked wording accordingly; overhauled summary output process to be more reliable and to include lists of both secured and unsecured services.
	Changes in v1.13 (2021/10/16 14:45):    Added parameter "Services"; tweaked warning message; added Info output of new image path.
	Changes in v1.12 (2021/10/15 19:26):    Added parameter "FullOutput"; changed structure of output to make it clear what each piece of information is, include the image path by default, and use less indentation; added interactive warning prompt and parameter "Force" to suppress this; tested on Windows Server 2019 AD DS DC; changed unknown colour from yellow to gray to differentiate from warnings; changed pass colour from green to dark green so it's easier to make out for colourblind people.
	Changes in v1.11 (2021/10/13 21:48):    Changed detection of security principals from English string matching to SID matching to facilitate usage in non-English environments / OSes.
	Changes in v1.10 (2021/10/11 21:58):    Added handling of services where the executable / image path (1) contains spaces, (2) isn't quoted, and (3) has restrictive permissions for administrators (e.g., 'C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.GamingServices_2.57.20005.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\GamingServices.exe') by changing method from "sc config" to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\"; changed reporting from using display names to service names because some services have the same display names but different service names (e.g, "Gaming Services" x 2 vs "GamingServices" and "GamingServicesNet").
	Changes in v1.9 (2021/02/06 20:48):     Added fixing of services with spaces and without quotation marks, fixed bug where summary would report that Windows services couldn't be secured when they actually had been, added summary deduplication.
	Changes in v1.8 (2020/03/06 14:08):     Added handling for Windows services where the paths don't actually exist.
	Changes in v1.7 (2019/11/21 10:14):     Corrected "Windows service secured" logic so that it'll only report if it was actually successful in securing it.
	Changes in v1.6 (2019/11/20 14:31):     Fixed compatibility with Windows 7 / PowerShell < 3.0.
	Changes in v1.5 (2019/11/20 13:43):     Added special handling for Windows services located in "C:\Windows\system32\" so that the permissions are reduced to read & execute instead of being removed.
	Changes in v1.4 (2019/11/20 12:33):     Added post-run report of which, if any, services were secured.
	Changes in v1.3 (2019/11/20 11:39):     Updated to bring in line with enhancements of Update-hMailServerCertificate v1.13 (write access check to log file, auto-elevate, coloured statuses, etc) and changed tags to Info, Unknown, Pass, FAIL, Success, and ERROR.
	Changes in v1.2 (2018/10/15):           Enhanced output by (1) changing output type from "check performed-action result" with just "action result" which makes it easier to read with less indentations, (2) adding tags ("[FAILED]", "[SUCCESS]", and "[NOTIFICATION]") for quick checking of results, and (3) tweaking logging behaviour.
	Changes in v1.1 (2018/10/05):           Added handling of inherited permissions.
	
.PARAMETER FullOutput
	Outputs (to console and log file) the full detail (e.g., original ACLs).
	
.PARAMETER LogOutput
	Logs the output to the default file path "C:\<hostname>_Secure-WindowsServices.txt".
	
.PARAMETER LogFile
	When used in combination with -LogOutput, logs the output to the custom specified file path.
	
.PARAMETER Force
	Suppresses (and, therefore, agrees to) the interactive warning prompt.
	
.PARAMETER Services
	List of Windows services' service names (NOT display names) to secure, rather than all. Case insensitive.
	
.PARAMETER ReportOnly
	Only report on insecure services - do not fix them.

.EXAMPLE
	Run with the default settings:
		Secure-WindowsServices

.EXAMPLE
	Run with full output:
		Secure-WindowsServices -FullOutput
		
.EXAMPLE 
	Run with the default settings AND logging to the default path:
		Secure-WindowsServices -LogOutput
	
.EXAMPLE 
	Run with the default settings AND logging to a custom local path:
		Secure-WindowsServices -LogOutput -LogPath "C:\$env:computername_Secure-WindowsServices.txt"
	
.EXAMPLE 
	Run with the default settings AND logging to a custom network path:
		Secure-WindowsServices -LogOutput -LogPath "\\servername\filesharename\$env:computername_Secure-WindowsServices.txt"
	
.EXAMPLE 
	Run without interactive warning prompt:
		Secure-WindowsServices -Force
	
.EXAMPLE 
	Run with a list of specific services to secure:
		Secure-WindowsServices -Services serviceNameExample1, serviceNameExample2
	
.EXAMPLE 
	Run but only report on vulnerabilities - do not fix them:
		Secure-WindowsServices -ReportOnly
